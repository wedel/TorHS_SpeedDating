# Speed Dating: A Performance-Enhanced Rendezvous Circuit for Tor
This is derived from my diploma theses on Tor Rendezvous Circuits.
 
 - **TorPS** contains Python Code as an expansion to the original **[The Tor Path Simulator (TorPS)](https://torps.github.io/)** for Hidden Services.
 - **TorPerf** contains PythonCode to anlyse modified rendezvous Circuits regarding their performance.
 - **TorPerf/data** contains aggregated data for a) a rough compairison between various circuitlength in [TorPerf/data/circuitlength](https://github.com/wedel/TorHS_SpeedDating/tree/master/torperf/data/circuitlength) and b) by a more realistic comparison of vanilla rendezvous circuits and a one-hop shorted circuit in [TorPerf/data/5Hops_rendezvous](https://github.com/wedel/TorHS_SpeedDating/tree/master/torperf/data/5Hops_rendezvous).
 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

bAnd repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
