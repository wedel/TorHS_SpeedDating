This is derived from my diploma theses on Tor Rendezvous Circuits.
 
 - TorPerf contains Files to anlyse modified rendezvous Circuits regarding their performance.
 -- TorPerf/data contains aggregated data for a) a rough compairison between various circuitlength in TorPerf/data/ 	circuitlength and b) by a more realistic comparison of vanilla rendezvous circuits and a one-hop shorted circuit in TorPerf/data/5Hops_rendezvous.
